  This data set includes bird point-count data collected during the
  breeding seasons (May-July) of 1999-2016 at 373 locations throughout
  Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.

      
  These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study
  (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at the Hubbard Brook
  Experimental Forest, which is operated and maintained by the USDA
  Forest Service, Northern Research Station.

  LOCATION DESCRIPTION

          
  The Hubbard Brook Valley bird area has been used extensively for
  studies of bird populations since the 1970s. The area is forested by
  typical northern hardwood species (sugar maple, beech and yellow
  birch) over about 85% of its area, and by patches of red spruce and
  balsam fir over the remaining 15%.

          
  SAMPLING DESIGN

          
  Each transect point was surveyed three times per year. The starting
  point and path among points differed for each of the three replicates
  to minimize the effects of visitation path on time of surveying. First
  round: valley bottom to ridge. Second round: Ridge to valley bottom.
  Third Round: mix of valley bottom to ridge and vice-versa. The survey
  began at 05:30 and was completed before 10:00. A 10 minute survey was
  conducted at each station, commencing 1 minute after arrival at a
  point. Surveys were conducted under satisfactory weather conditions:
  good visibility, little or no precipitation, light winds.

          
  Birds were recorded at two distances: within 50 meters and at 50 – 100
  meters. The species of all birds seen and heard were recorded as well
  as all individual squirrels and chipmunks seen and heard. The
  10-minute count was divided into 3 equal intervals (3 minutes, 20
  seconds). Periods were numbered as: 1=0–3:20 min, 2=3:21–6:40 min,
  3=6:41–10:00min. Each period was treated as a separate count (i.e.,
  Individuals in the later periods were counted even if they were
  detected in period 1).

          
  New.Record indicates a detection is new for the complete 10-minute
  count; for example if an individual is detected in the second period
  and was also detected in the first it received a 0. If it appears for
  the first time in the second period, it receives a 1. If an individual
  moves from the outer distance circle (50-100 m) to the 50 m circle
  during the count, this individual should be marked with a 1 in the
  New.Record column.

          
  If two male birds were detected simultaneously within 100 m at a
  count, both individuals received a 1 in the Counter.sing column. These
  data are critical in that they allow comparison with the point count
  method prior to 2006.
